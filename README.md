You are asked to create a project management system for a small structural engineering firm called “Poised”. Poised does the engineering needed to ensure the structural integrity of various buildings. They want you to create a Java program that they can use to keep track of the many projects on which they work.

## Description

The Poised Project Management Application allows the user to enter in information pertinent to a specific construction project 

Functionality for the user includes:
	▪ Reading and Writing from a text file
	▪ Create various personal specific to the project  (e.g. architect,
		building contractor, etc.)
	▪ Capture the details specific to the project
	▪ Change the due date of the project.
	▪ Change the total amount of the fee paid to date.
	▪ Update a contractor’s contact details.
	▪ Finalize the project -which will generate an invoice if there are outstanding amounts

The aim of this project is to show basic understanding of OOP whilst displaying an understanding of I/O functionality.

How can I use it?
Firstly, you need to clone this repository with the Task Manager program and related text files to a local repository on your computer, so that you can access and run the program. If you need help, follow the instructions as set out github help webpage:

https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository
In order to run this Poised Java program, you will then need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) onto your computer's operating system (OS):

https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/JDK_HowTo.html#jdk-install - Use this link as a guide to downloading and installing the JDK.
You will then need to install an integrated development environment (IDE) which is a program that enables you to view, write and run Java code. A link for an IDE called 'Eclipse' is provided below:

https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/EclipseJava_HowTo.html - Use this link as a guide to downloading and installing Eclipse.
